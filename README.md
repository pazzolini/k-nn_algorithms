# Evaluation and Comparison of K-NN Algorithms on Imbalanced Binary Classification Tasks

## Overview

This repository contains the practical assignment for **Machine Learning I (CC2008) - 2023/24**. The project focuses on evaluating and comparing different K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) variants in the context of **imbalanced binary classification**. The work includes preprocessing, model training, and performance analysis using **multiple datasets**.

## Notebook

I have included two versions of the notebook (jupyter and html), which provide a complete description of the assignment's process, including code, results and analysis.

## Other files and folders

Furthermore, I have also included the following folders and files (mentioned in the notebook):

- DS: contains the 10 datasets that were evaluated, as well as a file titled dslist.csv (list of datasets concerning binary classification tasks).
- Results: contains the first, second and additional benchmark evaluation results for each dataset (10 + 10 + 10 .csv files), the summary results for each evaluation (3 .csv files) and the comparisons (2 .csv files) between the performance of the first benchmark and the second benchmark, and the first benchmark and the additional benchmark.
- MLAlgorithms: contains the knn.py script (original algorithm) and the knn2.py script (with the proposed changes implemented by me).
